                    Dear patient,
                    
                    Your doctor has directed you to the Radiology department for some tests. Now, at the end of the exams and as you leave our department, we would like to ask you some questions about our department and your experience. Your answers will allow us to improve the quality of service offered to you as a patient. Your opinion is very important to us.
                    
                    It will only take a few minutes of your time. Please read each question carefully, choose your answer, and mark it. If you feel unable to answer a specific question, move on to the next one.
                    
                    For some questions, we would like you to give us a score ranging from 1 to 7: 7 means you are very satisfied and 1 means you are very dissatisfied. You can provide any score you deem appropriate. *[7=excellent, 6=very satisfied, 5=satisfied, 4=neutral, 3=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 2=dissatisfied, 1=very dissatisfied]*.
                    
                    ### Why Do We Want to Measure Patient Satisfaction?
                    1. Improvement of targeted services offered by the facility
                    2. Save our patients' time through a better Patient Experience in our facility
                    3. Monitoring strengths and areas of improvement of our facility
